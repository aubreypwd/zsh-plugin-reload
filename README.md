# `reload`

Simple function to reload your `$HOME/.zshrc` file (e.g. if you change it).

- _It will also source `$HOME/.zshrc.secure` if you have created that too._

## Usage

```bash
reload
```

## Install

Using [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen):

```bash
antigen bundle aubreypwd/zsh-plugin-reload@1.2.0
```

## Development

Install the package on `master`:

```bash
antigen bundle ssh://git@github.com/aubreypwd/zsh-plugin-reload
```

...and contribute upstream by working in `$HOME/.antigen/bundles/aubreypwd/zsh-plugin-reload`.
